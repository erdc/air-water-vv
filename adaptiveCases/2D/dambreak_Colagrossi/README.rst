Dambreak flow - Collagrosi and Landrini (2003)
==============================================

Description
-----------
The problem comprises a 0.60m x 1.20m (height x width) column of
water in a 1.8 m high and 3.22 m wide container. The column collapses under the action of gravity
and impacts to a wall. The top of the domain is
left open, when the rest of the boundary patches act as free slip walls.
In the following figure, a sketch of the dambreak initial conditions
is shown.

This case tests the ability of PROTEUS to simulate the free-surface
evolution and forces / pressures on structures, according to data that
are available in the following references.  For more details, see
runfiles or references.

Tests
-------
The python test file named ``test_dambreak_Colagrossi.py`` is made up of 
two tests:

* The first test is to check that the run is successfully completed.
* The second test is to validate the results comparing them to reference values. For this case we will compare the numerical and reference maximum pressure for a given point.
One can run this test file typing ``py.test --boxed test_dambreak_Colagrossi.py``.

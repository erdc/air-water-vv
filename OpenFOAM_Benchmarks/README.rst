Benchmark descritpion
----------------------------

- dambreakColagrossi, see  https://github.com/erdc-cm/air-water-vv/2d/dambreak_Colagrossi/README.rst

- dambreakWithObstacle, see http://foam.sourceforge.net/docs/Guides-a4/UserGuide.pdf (section 2.3) and https://github.com/erdc-cm/air-water-vv/2d/dambreak_Ubbink/README.rst

- lidDrivenCavity, see http://foam.sourceforge.net/docs/Guides-a4/UserGuide.pdf (Section 2.1)

- dambreakGomez, see https://github.com/erdc-cm/air-water-vv/blob/master/3d/dambreak_Gomez/README.rst

How to run OpenFOAM cases
------------------------
See OpenFOAM's user guide (http://foam.sourceforge.net/docs/Guides-a4/UserGuide.pdf), Section 2. Regarding this test set, see also recommenations below:

- In all cases, the mesh has to be generated by running blockMesh
- The dambreakColagrossi case has a series of probes placed at the left (downstream) wall, see case's controlDict file
- The dambreakGomez case has a grid of probes placed at the front and the back face of the obstacle see case's controlDict file
- The dambreakGomez case mesh is about ~6 million cells. In order to set a coarser mesh resolution, the constant/polymesh/blockMeshDict file needs to be edited before running blockMesh.

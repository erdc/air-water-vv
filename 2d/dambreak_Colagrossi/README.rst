Dambreak flow - Collagrosi and Landrini benchmark
===================

The problem consists of a 0.60m x 1.20m (height x width) column of
water, initially at rest, that collapses under the action of gravity
and impacts to a wall.  The computational domain is a rectangular box
with a heigth of 1.80m and a width of 3.22m.  The top of the domain is
left open, when the rest of the boundary patches act as no slip walls.
In the following figure, a sketch of the dambreak initial conditions
is shown.

This case tests the ability of PROTEUS to simulate the free-surface
evolution and forces / pressures on structures, according to data that
are available in the following references.  For more details, see
runfiles or references.

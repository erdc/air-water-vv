Linear wave propagation over a flat bottom  benchmark case
==========================================================

To consider a wave linear, its free-surface slope must be very small (~ 0.1%).  The free-surface slope depends on:

* The ratio of the wave height (H) to the wavelength (L), as an indication of the free-surface slope magnitude.
* The ratio of the wave height (H) to the depth (d), as an indication for the wave profile shape.  
Large height to depth ratios contribute in non-sinusoidal and steeper wave profiles.
Given the wave period, the wavelength will be a function of the water depth.  So it is the wave period, water depth and the wave height that contribute to the linearity or nonlinearity of the wave. 
Their interrelation is summarised in the following figure (Lé Méhauté 1976).

where, the vertical axis corresponds to the no dimensional wave height and the horizontal to the no dimensional water depth.  The term gT^2 is proportional to the wavelength in deep water and the dot named A corresponds to the tested case which is described below.   

The present problem consists of a 1.5m x 30.0m (height x length) numerical flume with a flat bottom and a mean water depth equal to 1.0m. At the left boundary, a linear wave is generated with a height of 0.025m and a period of 1.94s.

This case tests demonstrates the ability of PROTEUS to simulate the generation of linear waves as well as their absorption.

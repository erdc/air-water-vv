Solitary wave 
============================================

A solitary wave is a theoretical wave shape (Boussinesq, 1872) that is
often used in numerical wave simulations, partly because they have the
unique property of being 'stand-alone' waves that maintain their shape
and kinematics when propagated over a flat smooth surface.  By
measuring the properties of the wave as it propagates, the absence of
numerical dissipation during wave propagation can be confirmed.

The present problem consists of 2D rectangular numerical flume with
height, H, of 2.0 m and a length, L, of 60.0 m, where the mean water
depth, h, is equal to 1.0 m. At the left boundary, a solitary wave is
generated with a height of 0.05 m. Atmospheric conditions have been
assigned to the top boundary of the domain, the bottom boundary act as
a free-slip wall and in the right boundary a free outflow has been
assigned.  A sketch of the domain is given in the following figure.

This test case demonstrates the ability of PROTEUS to simulate the
generation and propagation of a solitary wave as well as its
absorption.

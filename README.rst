Organization of the test set
----------------------------

The tests are divided into two-dimensional and three-dimensional
tests, with additional subdivisions of those directores as needed. A
test consists of a single directory including

- A README file giving a brief overview of the problem and references
  to published work
- All data files describing the geometry and physical parameters of
  the problem
- A set of input files for a code
  (e.g. https://github.com/erdc-cm/proteus)
